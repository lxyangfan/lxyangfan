title: About Me 关于我
---

My name is **Frank**.
Currently, I work for a *financial tech company in Shanghai* China.
I have many hobbies, such as **fishing, photography, cooking, guita, thinking and talking**. Coding is just a part of my life.
I am not geek, and I do not really want to be. Because I think I am not so smart even though I got my **CS master degree from SJTU**.
I am not so experienced in coding or IT project but I know what I am good at. I like thinking and asking silly questions. And I like
communicating and hanging out with my friends. I am happy with that.
Again, welcome! And it is nice to meet you, and I want to make friends with U!
